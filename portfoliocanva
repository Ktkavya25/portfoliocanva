My name is Kavya K T. I am a recent Master of
Computer Applications graduate from Visvesvaraya
Technological University, with a strong foundation in software
development, programming, and web technologies. I am
proficient in Java, Python, C++, and web development
frameworks, and I have hands-on experience with MySQL and
various development tools like VSCode and IntelliJ IDEA.
During my internship at Eyesec Cyber Security Solution Pvt.

development, enhancing both my front-end and back-end
skills. I have also worked on several projects, including a hair
donation website for cancer patients and a user-centric machine

I am passionate about problem-solving and eager to contribute
to a dynamic software development team where I can apply my
skills and continue learning. Apart from coding, I enjoy
painting and arts & crafts. I look forward to opportunities that
allow me to grow and innovate in the field of software
